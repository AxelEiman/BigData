    "\n",
    "1. Simulate data\n",
    "Simulating useful data for the Lasso isn't complicated but to make sure you can focus on the interesting tasks I included a Python and a R version of a data-generating function. You can either ignore them and follow the description here, use them or take them as inspiration to write your own. The ideas are\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Generate n observations from an isometric normal distribution $N(0,Ip)$, i.e. theoretically uncorrelated features.\n",
    "    2. Generate regression coefficients beta as a vector that contains ceiling((1 - sparsity) p) non-zero elements [ceiling = closest integer less or equal to] that are normal distributed with a standard deviation of beta_scale. All other elements are zero.\n",
    "    3. At this point Xβ is the noise-less response and √∥Xβ∥22/(n−1) is its sample standard deviation. Signal-to-noise ratio is a measure for the proportion of the signal (noise-less response) standard deviation to the standard deviation of the noise, i.e. SNR = sd_signal / sd_noise. Specifying the SNR is a convenient way to determine what standard deviation for the noise is reasonable by choosing sd_noise = sd_signal / SNR. As an example, SNR = 2 means that the standard deviation of the noise-less is twice as large as the standard deviation of the noise and the noise-less response will be more \"pronounced\" the larger the SNR is. If 0 <= SNR < 1, then the noise is stronger than the signal which is hard to deal with for most methods.\n",
    "    4. Finally, the response is created in the form of a linear model y = X beta + sigma eps."
